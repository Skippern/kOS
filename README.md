# kOS Scripts 

A collection of kOS Scripts, as seen in my Kerbal Space Program's kOS boot script folder.

Parts of code miht have been collected from various sources, but mostly used as a syntax suggestion. I will work to develop my own code as far as possible.

All scripts will be tested, and adjustments might occure rapidly.

# TODO

* Quick setup, easy load

* Safe launch procedure

* Quick Orbit

* Planned Orbit

* Transfer to celestial bodies, with maneuver point planning and detection

* Safe landing from Orbit

* Plan science transmits to optimise radio connection

* Plan science transmits to avoid overbuffering

* Rendevouz with object

* Rover autopilot

* Ground vessel autopilot

* Atmospheric autopilot

# Complete

* LIB

    * Countdown - lib countdown, with HUD output, meant to be run directly from other programs.

* Telemetry

    * Orbit - All you need to know from a vessel in orbit or suborbit.

* Rover

    * Waypoint drivig - bad handling of obstacles and steep terrain, does not avoid water.

* Orbit

    * Gravity Turn - does gravity turn to get effectively to orbit while saving fuel.

# System Details

Scripts are tested and should work with following conditions:

* KSP 1.11.1 (Windows10)

* kOS Scriptable Autopilot System 1.3.2.0
