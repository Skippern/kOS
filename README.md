# kOS Scripts

A collection of kOS Scripts, as seen in my Kerbal Space Program's kOS boot script folder.

Parts of code miht have been collected from various sources, but mostly used as a syntax suggestion. I will work to develop my own code as far as possible.

All scripts will be tested, and adjustments might occure rapidly.

# Reasoning

Human have used computer assistance in spaceflight since first attempt to reach orbit. The first space flights had computers that was huge, clunky, and was extremely limited in their functionality. Since human control is prone to too many uncertainties, and space is such a hostile environment, computers are meant to reduce the number of uncertainties as much as possible within the limits of the technology and those building it.

The base for the idea was the original AGC/AGS/DSKY used on the Apollo flights, since their limitations is well within the abilities of kOS.

Newer space flights have much more advanced computers, allowing voice activated commands, touch screen display, and personalization of the display layout.

# DSKY

The DSKY was the control unit of AGC/AGS. I would like to recreate the DSKY as an Raspberry Pi unit, and control flight programs from there.

# Planned progression

To be able to reach the ultimate goal of a RPi DSKY, I would need to figure out each separate maneuver and how to execute them in KSP. Therefor I am breaking any complete flight or operation down into single tasks and tie them together. The `quick` folder is meant for quick scripts to test a sequence of script in certain order, or shortcut the execution of a certain task. The folder remains empty since none of these scripts are meant to be shared.

# System Details

### Windows

* Windows 10
* KSP 1.12.1
* kOS Scriptable Autopilot System 1.3.2.0

### Mac
