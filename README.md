# kOS Scripts 

A collection of kOS Scripts, as seen in my Kerbal Space Program's kOS boot script folder.

Parts of code miht have been collected from various sources, but mostly used as a syntax suggestion. I will work to develop my own code as far as possible.

All scripts will be tested, and adjustments might occure rapidly.
